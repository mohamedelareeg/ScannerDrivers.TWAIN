# TWAIN Scanner Driver for .NET Core 8

This repository demonstrates best practices for implementing a TWAIN Scanner Driver to work with .NET Core 8. Below is an overview of the main features and functionalities provided by this driver.

## Features

- **Initialization**: Initialize the TWAIN driver with appropriate settings.
- **Scanning**: Start, pause, and stop scanning operations.
- **Image Acquisition**: Acquire images from the scanner with various options such as image format and compression.
- **User Interface**: Enable and disable the TWAIN user interface for scanning.
- **Error Handling**: Handle errors and exceptions gracefully during the scanning process.

## Usage

To use this TWAIN Scanner Driver, follow these steps:

1. **Initialize the Driver**: Initialize the TWAIN driver with the desired settings using the `InitializeTwain` method.
2. **Start Scanning**: Start the scanning process by calling the `StartScanning` method.
3. **Pause Scanning** (Optional): Pause the scanning process if needed using the `PauseScanning` method.
4. **Stop Scanning**: Stop the scanning process using the `StopScanning` method.

## Repository Structure

The repository contains the following components:

- **TwainService.cs**: The main TWAIN service class responsible for initializing, starting, pausing, and stopping scanning operations.
- **Enums.cs**: Enumerations for TWAIN states, capabilities, and other related constants.
- **TWAINSDK.cs**: Wrapper class for the TWAIN DSM (Data Source Manager) API functions.
